# qt_doomfire
Qt / OpenGL implementation of the "DOOM fire"

Inspired by Fabien Sanglard: http://fabiensanglard.net/doom_fire_psx/index.html. 

I just had to :) No haterz plz. If you download the source, you'll get a starfield for free :D The sources are based on the Qt 2D painting example and I just hacked into the helper class for maximum throughput between baby screams and daiper changes.


Edit: 

Moved things around to actually make the two effects included separated. The DOOM fire code resides now only in doomfire.h/.cpp :)
